### What I learned

The frontend mentor challenge program has been quite intresting for me at this point. For this particular challenge, I learnt a lot of styling on CSS, even  though I still faced some difficulties, I was able to scale through most of them, whilst carrying out the task to the best of my abilities.


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I think I have bascially gotten the hang of general code writing in HTML. What I want to focus on is honing how I deploy my styling  that is CSS and I also want to Include JS in my field of work as well

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41RpXG_m2lI) -  This was an excellent resource for me on this particular project. Although the tutor was a bit fast, but nevertheless fantastic
